Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zhang Puyu and I am currently a fourth year **mathematics (primary major) and CS (second major)** undergraduate student in National University of Singapore. This website is about me, my thoughts and my projects.

I am an **aspiring game developer** who is **passion-driven**, **well-organised** and a little bit **perfectionist**. As of now, I am actively learning **game and software design and development** and **Japanese**. My interest in game development primarily lies in content design, world-building and tooling.

I mainly work with **C++** and **C#** in **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**. My past project experiences revolve around two video game projects:

1. [Dungeon Slayer](https://github.com/Z-Puyu/CS3247_Project), a rogue-like first-person deck-builder video game, which I developed together with other 5 amazing teammates with Unreal Engine 5.5. I took part in designing and implementing a **utility-based AI decision-making framework**, a **node-based crafting system emulating visual scripting**, as well as a **procedural level generation system**. I was also in charge of monitoring project progress and team management via Jira.
   
2. [Project: Supper Stretch](https://github.com/Z-Puyu/Project-Supper-Stretch), a self-initiated third-person dungeon adventure RPG, which I designed and developed on my own as a solo project in Unity. The purpose of this project is to practise implementing various common mechanics and systems from scratch, including but not limited to **animations**, **combo mechanics in melee combat**, **behaviour trees**, complex **character attribute systems** and **model-view-presenter architecture** in user interface design.

Beside these, I also did a website application student project, [HiveMind](https://github.com/Z-Puyu/hive-mind), with another partner using TypeScript and React. This application features a **modular lecture notes editor** with full-fledged support for rendering mathematical expressions and hyperlinks between document sections.
