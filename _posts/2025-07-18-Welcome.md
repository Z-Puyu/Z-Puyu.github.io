Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zhang Puyu and I am currently a fourth year **mathematics (primary major) and CS (second major)** undergraduate student in National University of Singapore. This website is about me, my thoughts and my projects.

I am an aspiring game developer. As of now, I am actively learning **game and software design and development** and **Japanese**. My interest in game development primarily lies in content design, world-building and tooling.
